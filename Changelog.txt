12/17/2008 8:51 PM - Added NppEditR as a script as a go between for R function edit to be able to

12/6/2008 8:50 AM - Finished integration of running simulations dialog.
	with this it may be necessary to look at the about dialog again and specify it as 2 permanantly and create
	it with script initialization.

	I'll need to read the AHK online docs to figure out why.
