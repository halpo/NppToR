	0. You should already have unzipped the folder containing this and the follwing files:
		*	GenerateSyntaxFile.exe (Generates and merges with any existing UserDefinedLang.xml file)
		*	iniparameters.txt (tells how to form the npptor.ini file)
		*	License.txt (A copy of the license used by NppToR)
		*	NppEditR.exe (a utility to enable Notepad++ as the default edit in R)
		*	NppToR.exe (Main file)
		
	1. Extract file to a permanant directory
	2. Update npptor.ini file to locate notepad++ and Rhome directories.  
		This is not necessary if both are standard installations, as the correct locations will be found via 
		the windows registry, and automatically adjust to new versions.
	3. Run NppToR.exe, this will also open Notepad++, which behavior can be turned off with the -startup 
		flag on a link
	4. Right click on the NppToR icon (R icon with a yellow triangle overlayed) and select 'Regenerate R 
		Syntax Files' from the menu.  This will regenerate the syntax files for R.  Repeat as you install
		new R packages to update the syntax files with the keywords for the newly installed packages.  This
		will close notepad++, if open, and restart when the files are updated.

Optional steps
	5. npptor requires that R run in sdi mode.  This can be enforced for R windows spawned by NppToR by
		including a file named Rconsole (no extension) with with the line
			MDI = no
		included, and most likely as the only line.
	6 npptor also has the ability to make R use notepad++ as the editor for commands like fix and edit by
		including the file Rprofile (no extension) with the line
			options(editor="PATH\\TO\\...\\NppToR\\NppEditR.exe")
		,fix the path as appropriate.  This line is R code so backslashes must be escaped with an extra 
		backslash, or can be replaced with forward slashes.
	7 Place a shortcut to NppToR.exe in the startup folder of your start/windows menu. Include the 
		-startup option on the command line to prevent notepad++ from opening at startup.
