# NppToR
NppToR is a companion utility that facilitates communication between R and Notepad++.
It provides code passing from Notepad++ into the windows R Gui.
NppToR also provides an autocompletion database which is dynamically generated from the users' R library of packages, thanks to an addition by Yihui Xie.
Notepad++ provides built it R code highlighting and folding.
