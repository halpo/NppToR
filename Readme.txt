Thank you for downloading ScripToR, my utility for passing code into R from notepad++.
The package consists of three parts.
	1.	Notepad++ Syntax Highlighting and code folding
	2. 	Auto Completion
	3.	Code passing via a hotkey utility
	
See Install.txt for installation instructions.

Upon running the utility,it sets two keyboard shortcuts to pass code into R:
	F8: Run line or Selection
	Ctrl+F8: Run entire file.
	Ctrl+Alt+F8: Run entire file in R CMD BATCH + open in Notepad++
	
To close the utility down right click the system tray icon and select exit.
This version runs only for the Rgui running in single document interface (SDI).

Note:
This requires R to be installed to start R.  It can be used with a portable version of R if R is already started.
Some feature will not work for portable versions of R or Notepad++.
